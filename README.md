  I am a PhD in Mathematics who has spent many years as an academic and some as a Mathematical Statistician.

  My background includes 17 years of experience at Universities in the US, Africa and India. In addition I have 
over five years of experience in applied statistical work using SAS and SQL.  This includes extracting 
multi-million record frame data using Teradata/SQL and using SAS to clean up sampling data from technicians 
in the field.  Further, I used SAS to help develop the quarterly sampling design. 

  My research has been in the area of computational number theory.  I have used Python, C, and MAXIMA on 
  Linux and Windows operating systems, resulting in a total of 21 papers in international level mathematics 
  journals.  My breakthrough results were new demonstrations of Four Squares Theorems in some quadratic
  fields.  This lead to the first few examples of non-classical quaternary quadratic forms over number
  fields.
